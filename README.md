# firing-robot-object
This is a basic example on how OOP works. A Robot() class is created with some attributes and methods such as movement, fire, and status. The initial position is (10, 10) and the fuel amount is 100.

It is operated using the following commands:

"left" = To move left one step. Decrease the fuel by 5.
"right" = To move right one step. Decrease the fuel by 5.
"up" = To move up one step. Decrease the fuel by 5.
"down" = To move down one step. Decrease the fuel by 5.
"fire" = Will decrease the fuel by 15 and prints "pew! pew!" to the command prompt.
"status" = Shows the amount of fuel and current position.
"quit" = Prints "Goodbye." and terminates the program.
